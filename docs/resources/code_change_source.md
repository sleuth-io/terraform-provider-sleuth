## Schema

### Required

- `deploy_tracking_type` (String) How to track deploys. Valid choices are build, manual, auto_pr, auto_tag, auto_push
- `name` (String) Code change source name
- `project_slug` (String) The slug of the project that this code change source belongs to.

### Optional

- `auto_tracking_delay` (Number) The delay to add to a deployment event
- `build_mappings` (Block List) Build mappings of the code change source. They must be ordered by environment_slug ascending to avoid Terraform plan changes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--build_mappings))
- `collect_impact` (Boolean) Whether to collect impact for its deploys
- `environment_mappings` (Block List) Environment mappings of the code change source. They must be ordered by environment_slug ascending to avoid Terraform plan changes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--environment_mappings))
- `include_in_dashboard` (Boolean) Whether to include deploys from this change source in the metrics dashboard
- `notify_in_slack` (Boolean) Whether to send Slack notifications for deploys or not
- `path_prefix` (String) What code source path to limit this deployment to. Useful for monorepos. Must be used with the [jsonencode()](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode) function to specify the paths to include and/or exclude respectively. (see example above)
- `repository` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--repository))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `slug` (String)

- `match_branch_to_environment` (Boolean) Whether only builds performed on the branch mapped from the environment are tracked or not. Basically if you only want Sleuth to find builds that were triggeredby a change on the branch that is configured for the environment, set this to false. Defaults to true
- `project_key` (String) The build project key
